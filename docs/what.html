        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>We have decided to create a web app which gives users the ability to preview the look of items of clothing on
            a
            model. The app will allow users to select pictures of pre loaded clothes and see what they will look like
            together, for example a user will be able to select a t-shirt and a pair of jeans and the program will
            generate
            each of these on an avatar on the screen. This will allow the user to get an accurate representation of what
            the
            clothes will look like. Users will then be able to follow a link provided by the site which takes them to a
            store front that has the items of clothing they are previewing for sale. We will have different sections for
            Pants, t-shirts and other items of clothing to make the user experience more friendly and organized.</p>
        <p>The clothes on the website will be clearly labeled so the user is quickly able to tell the brand and name of
            the
            clothes that they are previewing. The majority of the page will be taken up by the model that the clothes
            will
            be placed on and then next to this model will be the selection of clothes that the user can place on the
            model.
            Next to the pieces of clothing will be links that take the user to a storefront that sells that piece of
            clothing allowing them to quickly access a vendor for this piece.</p>
        <p>The user will also be able to do actions like generate random outfits to preview and save outfits that they
            like
            for later viewing.</p>
        <p>The main aspects for the functionality of the site will be typical web programming strategies such as HTML,
            CSS
            and Javascript. Event listeners to check for user input on the pictures and buttons to load up the model
            with
            the clothes will be the strategy to load the pieces of clothing on the model. Loading images from pre loaded
            links will then be used to create the model with the appropriate pieces of clothing. For the storage of
            clothes
            and images some databasing may be necessary to implement.
        </p>
        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>As a user I want to see if a t-shirt matches a pair of jeans so that I can decide if I want to buy this
                t-shirt.</li>
            <li>As a user I want to follow a link to a storefront that sells my previewed t-shirt so that I can purchase
                it.
            </li>
            <li>As a user I want to share an outfit on social media so that I can see what my friends think</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>COVID making people stay indoors/unable to shop for proper sized clothing</li>
            <li>Helps with online purchasing as sizes may be different in different countries etc.

            </li>
            <li>Allows for a visual platform for users to see how their outfits will look before purchasing.
            </li>
            <li>Can assist people wanting to expand their wardrobe/style as well as introduce them to new styles of
                clothing.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Given the current situation Victoria is in, many people are not able to leave their suburbs, let alone
            purchase clothes and visit non-essential stores. Due to these restrictions that are in place, people are
            unable to receive a proper shopping experience which can lead to unexpected outcomes when online shopping,
            whether that be incorrect sizing or simply purchasing clothes that do not fit into their current wardrobe.
            We also quickly found that all members of the group share a common interest for clothing and trying new
            styles of clothing, as well as window shopping and browsing through various retailers and stores, prior to
            the current restrictions that are in place. As a result we decided to create a platform that would allow for
            a visual representation of what different pieces of clothing would look like together when worn in the same
            outfit, while also assisting online purchases in ensuring that the correct size of clothing is brought. In
            addition to this project being used as a tool for online shopping during COVID-19, individuals that are
            looking to expand their wardrobe and style would be able to see how different pieces of clothing would look
            like with each other before purchasing.
