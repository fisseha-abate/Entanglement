    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>We have decided to create a web app which gives users the ability to preview the look of items of clothing on a
        model. The app will allow users to select pictures of pre loaded clothes and see what they will look like
        together, for example a user will be able to select a t-shirt and a pair of jeans and the program will generate
        each of these on an avatar on the screen. This will allow the user to get an accurate representation of what the
        clothes will look like. Users will then be able to follow a link provided by the site which takes them to a
        store front that has the items of clothing they are previewing for sale. We will have different sections for
        Pants, t-shirts and other items of clothing to make the user experience more friendly and organized.</p>
    <p>The clothes on the website will be clearly labeled so the user is quickly able to tell the brand and name of the
        clothes that they are previewing. The majority of the page will be taken up by the model that the clothes will
        be placed on and then next to this model will be the selection of clothes that the user can place on the model.
        Next to the pieces of clothing will be links that take the user to a storefront that sells that piece of
        clothing allowing them to quickly access a vendor for this piece.</p>
    <p>The user will also be able to do actions like generate random outfits to preview and save outfits that they like
        for later viewing.</p>
    <p>The main aspects for the functionality of the site will be typical web programming strategies such as HTML, CSS
        and Javascript. Event listeners to check for user input on the pictures and buttons to load up the model with
        the clothes will be the strategy to load the pieces of clothing on the model. Loading images from pre loaded
        links will then be used to create the model with the appropriate pieces of clothing. For the storage of clothes
        and images some databasing may be necessary to implement.
    </p>
<h2>User Stories</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>As a user I want to see if a t-shirt matches a pair of jeans so that I can decide if I want to buy this
            t-shirt.</li>
        <li>As a user I want to follow a link to a storefront that sells my previewed t-shirt so that I can purchase it.
        </li>
        <li>As a user I want to share an outfit on social media so that I can see what my friends think</li>
    </ul>
