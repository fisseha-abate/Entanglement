        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>We have decided to create a web app which gives users the ability to preview the look of items of clothing on
            a
            model. The app will allow users to select pictures of pre loaded clothes and see what they will look like
            together, for example a user will be able to select a t-shirt and a pair of jeans and the program will
            generate
            each of these on an avatar on the screen. This will allow the user to get an accurate representation of what
            the
            clothes will look like. Users will then be able to follow a link provided by the site which takes them to a
            store front that has the items of clothing they are previewing for sale. We will have different sections for
            Pants, t-shirts and other items of clothing to make the user experience more friendly and organized.</p>
        <p>The clothes on the website will be clearly labeled so the user is quickly able to tell the brand and name of
            the
            clothes that they are previewing. The majority of the page will be taken up by the model that the clothes
            will
            be placed on and then next to this model will be the selection of clothes that the user can place on the
            model.
            Next to the pieces of clothing will be links that take the user to a storefront that sells that piece of
            clothing allowing them to quickly access a vendor for this piece.</p>
        <p>The user will also be able to do actions like generate random outfits to preview and save outfits that they
            like
            for later viewing.</p>
        <p>The main aspects for the functionality of the site will be typical web programming strategies such as HTML,
            CSS
            and Javascript. Event listeners to check for user input on the pictures and buttons to load up the model
            with
            the clothes will be the strategy to load the pieces of clothing on the model. Loading images from pre loaded
            links will then be used to create the model with the appropriate pieces of clothing. For the storage of
            clothes
            and images some databasing may be necessary to implement.
        </p>
        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>As a user I want to see if a t-shirt matches a pair of jeans so that I can decide if I want to buy this
                t-shirt.</li>
            <li>As a user I want to follow a link to a storefront that sells my previewed t-shirt so that I can purchase
                it.
            </li>
            <li>As a user I want to share an outfit on social media so that I can see what my friends think</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Use Case Diagram</h2>

        <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>COVID making people stay indoors/unable to shop for proper sized clothing</li>
            <li>Helps with online purchasing as sizes may be different in different countries etc.

            </li>
            <li>Allows for a visual platform for users to see how their outfits will look before purchasing.
            </li>
            <li>Can assist people wanting to expand their wardrobe/style as well as introduce them to new styles of
                clothing.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Given the current situation Victoria is in, many people are not able to leave their suburbs, let alone
            purchase clothes and visit non-essential stores. Due to these restrictions that are in place, people are
            unable to receive a proper shopping experience which can lead to unexpected outcomes when online shopping,
            whether that be incorrect sizing or simply purchasing clothes that do not fit into their current wardrobe.
            We also quickly found that all members of the group share a common interest for clothing and trying new
            styles of clothing, as well as window shopping and browsing through various retailers and stores, prior to
            the current restrictions that are in place. As a result we decided to create a platform that would allow for
            a visual representation of what different pieces of clothing would look like together when worn in the same
            outfit, while also assisting online purchases in ensuring that the correct size of clothing is brought. In
            addition to this project being used as a tool for online shopping during COVID-19, individuals that are
            looking to expand their wardrobe and style would be able to see how different pieces of clothing would look
            like with each other before purchasing.

        </p>

        <h2>Beyond current capabilities</h2>
        <p>Currently, most members of the group are most comfortable in web programming with HTML and CSS, when it comes
            to the IT skills required by this project. However, as obtained from the team profile, it can be said that
            programming in JavaScript is a common weak point across the group. The project involves extensive web
            programming with the use of JavaScript. This ties in well with the idea of using this project to extend the
            current IT knowledge of the team as JavaScript is an area the group is looking to improve on. Therefore, in
            order to meet the goal of this project, each member of the group will put in great time and effort in
            improving on their JavaScript skills, which will likely involve personal learning and practicing of syntax,
            algorithms, etc. In large, these practices will be of great benefit to each group member’s IT development.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Justification</h2>
        <p>For the workload of this project, it will be divided by the strong suits that each individual member believes
            they accel at.
            We will then assess the value of each task that is placed on each member, to weigh which ones are more
            important than other tasks or vice versa.
            This is to ensure that the tasks divided are fair and correlate with the strength of each respective member.
            Through this, we can continue with what is <strong><u>expected</u></strong> with each members workload:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Each person is expected to have spent roughly one hour each day of
                this project, resulting in an estimated 7 hours of work dedicated to this project a week</li>

            <li>Each person attends all meetings each week and relays information to other
                group members and the respective tutor to confirm that things are
                going according to plan, and if not, used the time to help with issues expressed</li>

            <li>Each person stays on top of their work on a weekly basis so that things can
                continue smoothly and not interrupt any other members workflow for other classes.</li>

            <li>Each person clearly understands what tasks they are allocated
                with, resulting in less confusion and unnecessary work such as writing a part twice.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>While this would be considered the optimal way to go about this, sometimes
            there will be obstacles that might need to be addressed (<strong><u>actual workloads</u></strong>):</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Dates of certain assignments or work gets pushed back resulting in a readjustment of proximity of due
                dates.</li>

            <li>Perceptions of difficulty that each member may have with their tasks which could result in dedicating
                longer amounts of time (or not)</li>

            <li>Personal reasons that may conflict with their expected workload
                which could result in less time being dedicated (or not)</li>

            <li>Other assignments from other classes that demand more attention or are urgent
                to finish, as each member has a set of different classes from others.
                This can result in not being 100% focused during each expected time period</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Risks</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Clothing Sizes</strong><br>
            Example: Clothing sizes may not be 100% accurate... <br>
            Mitigation: Finding the dimensions and proportions of each clothing and scaling the images accordingly. <br>
            <strong>Wrong Body Size</strong><br>
            Example: The listed body types isn’t one that the customer can use due to not being accurate. <br>
            Mitigation: To have multiple body types to cover the different types of people and to use examples when
            creating virtual bodies. <br>
            <strong>Mat not be able to built multiple virtual bodies</strong><br>
            Example: The building of the multiple virtual bodies may be above our abilities to make if we’re trying to
            build a body to accompany every different body type. <br>
            Mitigation: To make an alternate solution to cover most body types using the least amount of bodies. <br>
