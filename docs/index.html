<p>I have long been interested in Information Technology ever since I was a small child. Growing up, I found devices such as computers, mobile phones along with other tech gadgets quite intriguing. This curiosity would then drive me to finding out more about computers and how they functioned. Although I had growing interests for other fields such as sports and art, along the road, IT was the one thing I always had the most interest for.
    Given that I have had a lot more experience in it, I would have to say that my strongest point is programming. When it comes to general skills, I believe that I excel in problem solving and creative thinking.  
    In the context of this project, it is fair to say that my web programming skills arenâ€™t as profound. 
    I generally attempt to contribute in all areas of a group project, however, in this case, I will probably be more invested in design related tasks and managing github.
