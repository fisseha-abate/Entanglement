    <h2>Project Justification</h2>
<p>For the workload of this project, it will be divided by the strong suits that each individual member believes they accel at, as highlighted 
    in the section further down. We will then assess the value of each task that is placed on each member, to weigh which ones are more important than other tasks or vice versa. 
    This is to ensure that the tasks divided are fair and correlate with the strength of each respective member. 
    Through this, we can continue with what is <strong><u>expected</u></strong> with each members workload:</p>
    
<ul>
    
<li>Each person is expected to have spent roughly one hour each day of 
    this project, resulting in an estimated 7 hours of work dedicated to this project a week</li>
    
<li>Each person attends all meetings each week and relays information to other 
    group members and the respective tutor to confirm that things are 
    going according to plan, and if not, used the time to help with issues expressed</li>
    
<li>Each person stays on top of their work on a weekly basis so that things can 
    continue smoothly and not interrupt any other members workflow for other classes.</li>
    
<li>Each person clearly understands what tasks they are allocated 
    with, resulting in less confusion and unnecessary work such as writing a part twice.</li>
    
</ul>
    
<p>While this would be considered the optimal way to go about this, sometimes 
    there will be obstacles that might need to be addressed (<strong><u>actual workloads</u></strong>):</p>
    
<ul>
    
<li>Dates of certain assignments or work gets pushed back resulting in a readjustment of proximity of due dates.</li>
    
<li>Perceptions of difficulty that each member may have with their tasks which could result in dedicating longer amounts of time (or not)</li>
    
<li>Personal reasons that may conflict with their expected workload 
    which could result in less time being dedicated (or not)</li>
    
<li>Other assignments from other classes that demand more attention or are urgent 
    to finish, as each member has a set of different classes from others. 
    This can result in not being 100% focused during each expected time period</li>
    
</ul>
