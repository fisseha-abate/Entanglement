    <h2>Project Justification</h2>
<p>For the workload of this project, it will be divided by the strong suits that each individual member believes they accel at, as highlighted 
    in the section further down. We will then assess the value of each task that is placed on each member, to weigh which ones are more important than other tasks or vice versa. 
    This is to ensure that the tasks divided are fair and correlate with the strength of each respective member. 
    Through this, we can continue with what is <strong><u>expected</u></strong> with each members workload:</p>
    
<ul>
    
<li>Each person is expected to have spent roughly one hour each day of 
    this project, resulting in an estimated 7 hours of work dedicated to this project a week</li>
    
<li>Each person attends all meetings each week and relays information to other 
    group members and the respective tutor to confirm that things are 
    going according to plan, and if not, used the time to help with issues expressed</li>
    
<li>Each person stays on top of their work on a weekly basis so that things can 
    continue smoothly and not interrupt any other members workflow for other classes.</li>
    
<li>Each person clearly understands what tasks they are allocated 
    with, resulting in less confusion and unnecessary work such as writing a part twice.</li>
    
</ul>
    
<p>While this would be considered the optimal way to go about this, sometimes 
    there will be obstacles that might need to be addressed (<strong><u>actual workloads</u></strong>):</p>
    
<ul>
    
<li>Dates of certain assignments or work gets pushed back resulting in a readjustment of proximity of due dates.</li>
    
<li>Perceptions of difficulty that each member may have with their tasks which could result in dedicating longer amounts of time (or not)</li>
    
<li>Personal reasons that may conflict with their expected workload 
    which could result in less time being dedicated (or not)</li>
    
<li>Other assignments from other classes that demand more attention or are urgent 
    to finish, as each member has a set of different classes from others. 
    This can result in not being 100% focused during each expected time period</li>
    
</ul>
     

    <h2>Resources & Tools</h2>
    <h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
    <p> We will use MS Teams to hold face-to-face meetings between all members as well as tutor/lecturer throughout the
        various phases of the project. This platform will be beneficial for group members to clearly discuss and share
        ideas
        as opposed to communicating through email/text messaging.</p>

    <h3>GitHub</h3>
    <P>GitHub is a code hosting platform that will allow all members to contribute and make changes to our web based
        project. As our project will require HTML and JavaScript, all group members will be able to have access to all
        files/code related to creating our assignment. Other platforms that could be used for real-time code
        collaboration
        include <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio
            Code</a>
    </p>



    <h3>Trello</h3>
    <p>Trello is a collaborative board where team members are able to organise, delegate and plan their work using a
        visual
        platform. Our group will aim to plan our work/phases using a collaborative Trello board. This will be done in
        order
        to keep track of tasks that need to be completed, delegate tasks to each member and show to members of the group
        what each individual will be or is working on. Ultimately, Trello will play a large part in monitoring our
        progress
        and ensuring we remain on track throughout the development process. Alternative platforms that couldâ€™ve also
        been
        used to track team progress include <a
            href="https://asana.com/campaign/pac/think?&utm_campaign=Brand--ANZ--EN--Core--Desktop--Exact&utm_source=google&utm_medium=pd_cpc_br&gclid=CjwKCAjw1K75BRAEEiwAd41h1AlDHfok-f_YjPVIHajuW7n1QWXRRbbdZQHvr0TVolmvM3TaDfHK0RoCEEAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Asana</a>
        or <a
            href="https://taskworld.com/taskworld-vs-project-management-tool/?utm_source=capterra&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=capterra_task_management&title=It+shouldn%C2%BFt+be+a+pain+to+use+task+management+tool">TaskWorld</a>
    </p>
    <h3>AWS:</h3>
    <p>  AWS will be used to host our assignments as well as our final project.</p>
    <h2>Collaborative workspaces</h2>
    <p><strong>Google Docs:</strong> We will use <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRUnwZ6DJIxGR3s-nBzNu4U9NMy9W650txp4jUJsIH0/edit#">this</a>
        platform for collaborative work, where members can see/review each other's work before uploading to AWS website.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Microsoft Teams:</strong> We will use MS Teams for face-to-face meetings between all members as well as
        tutor/lecturer
        meetings. Communication between team members will also occur in the channel.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>GitHub:</strong>
    All members will use GitHub to make changes to our HTML and CSS files. As our project will be web based, GitHub
    will also be used beyond this assignment .</p>
    

    <p><strong>Trello :</strong> Trello will be used as a visual representation of the work done by each member. It will also help group
        members keep up with any work that needs to be done/has been done.</p>
