    <h2>Resources & Tools</h2>
    <p>Microsoft Teams
        We will use MS Teams to hold face-to-face meetings between all members as well as tutor/lecturer throughout the
        various phases of the project. This platform will be beneficial for group members to clearly discuss and share
        ideas
        as opposed to communicating through email/text messaging.</p>

    GitHub</h3>
    <P>GitHub is a code hosting platform that will allow all members to contribute and make changes to our web based
        project. As our project will require HTML and JavaScript, all group members will be able to have access to all
        files/code related to creating our assignment. Other platforms that could be used for real-time code
        collaboration
        include <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio
            Code</a>
    </p>



    <h3>Trello</h3>
    <p>Trello is a collaborative board where team members are able to organise, delegate and plan their work using a visual
    platform. Our group will aim to plan our work/phases using a collaborative Trello board. This will be done in order
    to keep track of tasks that need to be completed, delegate tasks to each member and show to members of the group
    what each individual will be or is working on. Ultimately, Trello will play a large part in monitoring our progress
    and ensuring we remain on track throughout the development process. Alternative platforms that couldâ€™ve also been
    used to track team progress include <a
