        <h2>Resources & Tools</h2>
        <h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
        <p> We will use MS Teams to hold face-to-face meetings between all members as well as tutor/lecturer throughout
            the
            various phases of the project. This platform will be beneficial for group members to clearly discuss and
            share
            ideas
            as opposed to communicating through email/text messaging.</p>

        <h3>GitHub</h3>
        <P>GitHub is a code hosting platform that will allow all members to contribute and make changes to our web based
            project with the use of a common <a href="https://github.com/fisseha-abate/Entanglement" target="_blank">repository</a>. As our project will require HTML and JavaScript, all group members will be able to have access to
            all
            files/code related to creating our assignment. Other platforms that could be used for real-time code
            collaboration
            include <a href="http://brackets.io/" target="_blank">Brackets</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Visual Studio
                Code</a>
        </p>



        <h3>Trello</h3>
        <p>Trello is a collaborative board where team members are able to organise, delegate and plan their work using a
            visual
            platform. Our group will aim to plan our work/phases using a collaborative Trello board. This will be done
            in
            order
            to keep track of tasks that need to be completed, delegate tasks to each member and show to members of the
            group
            what each individual will be or is working on. Ultimately, Trello will play a large part in monitoring our
            progress
            and ensuring we remain on track throughout the development process. Alternative platforms that couldâ€™ve also
            been
            used to track team progress include <a
                href="https://asana.com/campaign/pac/think?&utm_campaign=Brand--ANZ--EN--Core--Desktop--Exact&utm_source=google&utm_medium=pd_cpc_br&gclid=CjwKCAjw1K75BRAEEiwAd41h1AlDHfok-f_YjPVIHajuW7n1QWXRRbbdZQHvr0TVolmvM3TaDfHK0RoCEEAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">Asana</a>
            or <a
                href="https://taskworld.com/taskworld-vs-project-management-tool/?utm_source=capterra&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=capterra_task_management&title=It+shouldn%C2%BFt+be+a+pain+to+use+task+management+tool" target="_blank">TaskWorld</a>
        </p>
        <h3>AWS:</h3>
        <p> AWS will be used to host our assignments as well as our final project.</p>
        <h2>Collaborative workspaces</h2>
        <p><strong>Google Docs:</strong> We will use <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRUnwZ6DJIxGR3s-nBzNu4U9NMy9W650txp4jUJsIH0/edit#" target="_blank">this</a>
            platform for collaborative work, where members can see/review each other's work before uploading to AWS
            website.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Microsoft Teams:</strong> We will use MS Teams for face-to-face meetings between all members as well
            as
            tutor/lecturer
            meetings. Communication between team members will also occur in the channel.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>GitHub:</strong>
            All members will use GitHub to make changes to our HTML and CSS files. As our project will be web based,
            GitHub
            will also be used beyond this assignment .</p>


        <p><strong>Trello :</strong> Trello will be used as a visual representation of the work done by each member. It
            will also help group
            members keep up with any work that needs to be done/has been done.</p>
