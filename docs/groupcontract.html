                communication and member relationships.
            </li>
            <li>Members will be expected to attend at least one of the weekly meetings at the decided upon time as well
                as the scheduled tutorial that each member is enrolled in. These meetings will amount to approximately
                3-4 hours a week of planning and communication about the current state of members workflow.</li>
            <li>Members are expected to have the current progress of their work updated on Trello prior to the meeting

                meeting.</li>
            <li>Members are expected to contribute to and volunteer for work if needed, waiting to be assigned work by
                others and not offering help in areas that are needed is not acceptable.</li>

            <li>If Any of these expectations are breached further action may be taken following the guidelines laid out

        </ul>
        <h2>Task Assignment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Paul - </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Cliff - </strong></li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Unmet Expectations</h2>
        <p>
            If members are having trouble finishing any assigned work they are expected to notify the group at least 5
            days before the decided upon due date and let the other group members know so alternative arrangements can
            be made.
            Any problems that arise will initially be attempted to be dealt with by our group members, those involved
            with the issue will need to be present and at least one other group member will need to be present for
            mediation if necessary. If a solution cannot be reached or group members are not in attendance to the
            resolution session the issue will be escalated to our tutor and or course coordinator. Examples of problems
            that could arise include but are not limited to unfinished work, disagreements on quantity or quality of
            work, group participation and repeated requests for work extension beyond decided due date.

        </p>
        <h2>Peer Feedback</h2>
        <p>
            An anonymous document that members can use to offer feedback will be used at the end of each assignment
            submission for constructive feedback and criticism only. Each member will then be given their relevant
            feedback for reflection.
            Members agree to being given feedback throughout the duration of the assignment if other group members feel
            that it is needed, this can be brought up at weekly meetings or through communication channels such as
            Microsoft Teams, any instances of this should also be recorded in feedback given at the end of each
            assignment.
        </p>
        <h2>Responses</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p>
            Use of Trello for keeping track of current tasks will be used and members are expected to update the status
            of their assignments using the Trello cards when appropriate, the Trello board has been shared and confirmed
            with each group member. Prior to the beginning of each of the weekly meetings members are expected to have
            their Trello assignment cards up to date and be accurate to the current progress of their assigned work.
            Meetings will be held using Microsoft Teams at predetermined times agreed upon by all members, these
            meetings will be recorded and archived for any further reference if needed. Teams will also be used for
            scheduling meetings using the calendar. Trello will be linked to the our group teams page for easy access
            and convenience.
            Github will be used by all members for the back up and sharing of our documents, the Github repository has
            already been created and shared and confirmed with each member with each member. Prior to each weekly
            meeting members are expected to have their documentation and files up to date on Github for accurate and up
            to date file sharing.
